This project was created to showcase how the Contentful [App Framework](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/) can be used
in conjunction with [Forma-36](https://f36.contentful.com/) and the
[open source field editors](https://contentful-field-editors.netlify.app/) to
create a custom rich text editor experience for users who work with assets.

This project was bootstrapped using the [Create Contentful App](https://github.com/contentful/create-contentful-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Creates or updates your app definition in contentful, and runs the app in development mode.
Open your app to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Libraries to use

- [Forma 36](https://f36.contentful.com/) – Contentful's design system
